1.	Overview of the analysis: 

The purpose of this analysis is to provide more information about temperature trends to W. Avy before the opening of his surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
The following information will be provided to W.Avy based on the analysis performed:
•	Summary Statistics for June
•	Summary Statistics for December
•	Report for the statistical analysis 


2.	Results:


a)	The summary statistics for June Temperature analysis shows a maximum temperature of 85 degrees.
b)	The summary statistics for June Temperature shows a minimum temperature of 64 degrees and an average temperature of approximately 75 degrees.

3.	Summary: 

Based on the data analyzed, the average the average temperature in Oahu is approximately 75 degrees for June and 71 degrees for December. As such, W.Avy may proceed with opening the shop. However, the ice cream shop may record low sales in December as temperature could drop as low as 56 degrees in December.

Additional queries that can be performed for June and December will be dividing the temperature observations into bins and plotting a histogram to see the vast majority of the observations for each month.
